# Simple Paint Program
This is a basic program heavily based off of Microsoft's Paint application, where the user can draw anything with a 10 color limitation.<br />
<br />
p5.js was used to create the user interface and ability to draw.<br />
<br />
Implementing the ability to draw was the toughest part of this project, but after some research and looking through the p5.js documentation, I was able to overcome this issue.
<br />
<br />
No further updates will be made to this project.<br />
